    </ul>
    <h2>Possible Obstacles</h2>
    <p>During this week, I anticipate a few potential obstacles that may affect my progress:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Busy work schedule</li>
      <li>Distractions at home</li>
      <li>Unexpected events or commitments</li>
      <li>Feeling overwhelmed</li>
      <li>Feeling nervous</li>
      <li>Feeling unhealthy</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How I Plan to Deal with These Obstacles</h2>
    <p>To overcome these obstacles, I have come up with the following strategies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Prioritize my tasks and manage my time effectively</li>
      <li>Create a dedicated and distraction-free study environment</li>
      <li>Be flexible and adaptable to handle unexpected events</li>
      <li>Practice stress management techniques and self-care activities</li>
      <li>Seek support from friends, family, or mentors</li>
      <li>Stay committed to my goals and remind myself of the importance of consistency</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Oftentimes, distractions and procrastination are just symptoms of deeper unacknowledged emotions. 
By being aware of these emotions and accepting them, it is easier to get back on track. 
I will keep a daily task schedule and manage my time by using Google Calendar and sticking to the time slots set in Google Calendar. 
I will also seek support from my family and friends, not just for financial issues, but also for emotional support and to have a place to vent. 
It is important to be kind to myself while maintaining a productive mindset.</p>
