    </ul>
    <h2>Possible Obstacles</h2>
    <p>During this week, I anticipate a few potential obstacles that may affect my progress:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Busy work schedule</li>
      <li>Distractions at home</li>
      <li>Unexpected events or commitments</li>
      <li>Feeling overwhelmed</li>
      <li>Feeling nervous</li>
      <li>Feeling unhealthy</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How I Plan to Deal with These Obstacles</h2>
    <p>To overcome these obstacles, I have come up with the following strategies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Prioritize my tasks and manage my time effectively</li>
      <li>Create a dedicated and distraction-free study environment</li>
      <li>Be flexible and adaptable to handle unexpected events</li>
      <li>Practice stress management techniques and self-care activities</li>
      <li>Seek support from friends, family, or mentors</li>
      <li>Stay committed to my goals and remind myself of the importance of consistency</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Oftentimes, distractions and procrastination are just symptoms of deeper unacknowledged emotions. 
By being aware of these emotions and accepting them, it is easier to get back on track. 
I will keep a daily task schedule and manage my time by using Google Calendar and sticking to the time slots set in Google Calendar. 
I will also seek support from my family and friends, not just for financial issues, but also for emotional support and to have a place to vent. 
It is important to be kind to myself while maintaining a productive mindset.</p>

  <p>I am running into some issues trying to learn for probability theory. The fact that im behind on the lectures and need to catch up with imperfect learning materials makes me second guess my approach on
    how i am learning the subject at hand all the time which extremely hinders my progress. I need to set a system in place to consistently learn this subject without second guessing myself. I am
    stressing myself out because im scared that I may not be able to catch up in time. I know I can do this. I have too much respect of the subject because I have postponed taking it for so long.
