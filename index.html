    <h1>Welcome to my personal website</h1>
    <p>This is a project on a website completely designed and built from scratch by myself.</p>
    <p>On this website i will post content mainly related to mathematics. The first big topic will be about 
      the Frank-Wolfe Algorithm. Explaining the algorithm showing use cases and providing valuable information as to what
      the benefits are compared to normal gradient descent in machine learning projects.
